To open up a surf shop in Oahu, one of the significant aspects is to analyze weather data. Therefore, we ran June and December weather data to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business would be profitable all year round.

                                                 #Analysis
                                                 
June has 1700 temperature readings, whereas December has 1517 temperature readings. Based on that, we can say:

•	The mean for both June and December temperature is in the same range as in the 70s.

•	During June, the temperature drops to 64 degrees, and December's lowest is 56 degrees.

•	The maximum temperature during June and December is pretty similar in the 80s.


                                                    #Summary

After running all the data, we concluded that opening a surf shop in Oahu is sustainable. We ran two additional queries to be more confident of our decision.

•	During June and December, temperature occurrences are around 70 degrees. From the diagram, we can depict the weather staying pretty much the same.
